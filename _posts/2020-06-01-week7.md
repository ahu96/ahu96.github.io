This week, we have wrapped up the work on calculate streak length. I merged the branch into main and practiced using source control. I also learned how to use a research server and created an executable file with calculate streak length functions so we can efficiently run the surveys on the research server. I also worked on milestone 3.  

I think the challenge this week is learning about the research server and the executable files. I have never written an executable file in python before so it took some digging around to figure out how to write the commands. I've also never used a research server so there's a learning curve with that too.
