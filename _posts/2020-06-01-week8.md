This week, we worked on creating my poster for the Rubin 2022 Project & Community Workshop (PCW). We worked on plotting example plots and adding in contents of the poster. We used test results from the previous test runs to create plots for the efficiency of the algorithm and evaluate the results. We ended with plots giving examples for the three simulated satellite constellations, as well plots evaluating the relationship between the dodging weight and the amount of pixels loss in pointings and plots evaluating the tradeoff between reducing pixel loss and lossing pixel depth. We concluded that given the current satellite population, dodging satellites with the Rubin scheduler is still not worth it yet as we risk lossing significant amount of image depth with a small amount of reduction in pixel loss. 

The most challenging part of this week was to practice plotting in python. It also took quite some time to pick out the right plots and modify them so they are clear and concise.
