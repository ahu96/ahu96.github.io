title: Week 1

During week1, we started with setting up all the dependencies and environments that I need to run the rubin sim scheduler. I also read background readings to help me better understand the problem that I'm trying to tackle and to understand what related works have already been done on this problem. We also went through a demo of the current rubin sim scheduler. 

Since I came from a CS and Math background, the astronomy terminologies were a bit daunting and difficult to understand. It took me a while to understand what all the terms meant and get familiar with the astronomy python packages like astropy.
