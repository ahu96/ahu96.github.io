This week, I worked on testing and optimizing the code. I tested the calculate streak length function on the baseline observation dataset and fixed some bugs in the code. I then started working on optimizing the run time. Since datasets are generally very large, we used numpy and shapely to optimize the code to decrease run time.

Optimizing code was a little bit challenging for me because this hasn't really been a big focus in my classes before (Intro classes don't really care about run time and more advanced classes use more succinct languages so run times are rarely a big concern). Therefore, it took me some digging around to figure out how to vectorize and map complex functions in an efficient way.
