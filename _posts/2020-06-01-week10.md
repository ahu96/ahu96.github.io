title: Week 10

This week mostly involves wrapping up the project. I worked on finishing the final report and revising it based on my mentor's suggestions. I also worked on wrapping up the website as well as cleaning up the Github repository. I made sure to push all changes to the github website and worked on a ReadMe. 

It is exciting to have a end project that I am proud of. My mentors and I will meet later next week to work out a plan for turning this into a paper.
