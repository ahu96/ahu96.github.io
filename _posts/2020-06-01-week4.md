This week, I have completed the majority of the calculate streak length function. I then worked on fixing style errors and adding in doc strings and other documentations. 

I think this part has generally been okay since my mentors have been very helpful. I think the biggest challenge is getting used to github source control. I have used github before but I haven't really worked on a project of this scale so I haven't done anything with sub-branches and so on. I learned a lot about the github workflow.
