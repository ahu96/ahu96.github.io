This week, I have started modifying and pulling out methods from the original repo to create a method that can calculate the satellite streak length in any given pointing. Basically, the method should take a potential satellite population and a single Rubin/LSST observation and computes the sum of all the satellite streak lengths in the observation. This builds on the original method which simply detects whether a satellite is in the pointing or not. I also added comments and docstrings to keep the code more organized. I also worked on this website to submit for the second milestone. 

This part wasn't very frustrating because my mentors have been very helpful. I think generally getting used to the different units is still a challenge. Figuring out how to project from a sphere to 2D and how to navigate mjd and the different coordinates are still a bit challenging.
