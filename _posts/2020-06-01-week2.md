title: Week 2
---

My task during week 2 was mostly to understand and break apart a previous repository. Rubin already has some code written that could check if a statellite appeared in a particular pointing. My job is to understand the job and start pulling out pieces that could be useful for my project. 

At this point, I'm starting to get used to the terminologies but I still needed to get used to the different ways that things are calculated. Since the Earth is a sphere, many calculations that I was used to in 2D does not quite work on a sphere. It also takes time to get used to mjd and different coordinates.
