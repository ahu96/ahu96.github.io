## About My Project
Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is a ten-year astronomical imaging survey that will begin in 2024 from a new telescope in Chile. Instead of soliciting individual requests for what the telescope should point at, the LSST will uniformly survey the sky every three nights in six color filters to essentially create a decade-long “high resolution color movie” of the entire southern sky, and share massive quantities of data products with the astronomy community. To accomplish this, there is a complex scheduler algorithm that takes into account various science priorities, what has recently been observed, how long it takes the telescope to move to a new target, etc. A new challenge has recently come up with a hugely increasing number of bright low-Earth-orbit satellites (e.g., Starlink) that will leave streaks in LSST images. However, there is not yet a plan to incorporate known commercial satellites into the Rubin scheduler so the worst of them may be avoided. My project is to create realistic simulated forecasts of satellite trajectories and brightnesses, build a tool that uses that data to create new scheduler constraints, and test what the impact is to various Rubin LSST observing programs. In my project, I will explore dodging the satellites predicted to be brightest, dodging areas of the sky with the largest number of forecast satellites, etc.
